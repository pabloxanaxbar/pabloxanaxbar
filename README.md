Hi, my names Dustin. I'm an IT guy. like most of us I have a passion for electronics, networking, machine learning, automation, data science, you name it. If I can understand enough of something I tend to learn to love it. 
Right now i'm just getting started on GitHub, trying to find repos withing my skillset to collaborate, brainstorm and learn. I'm well aware there are much smarter folks than I on here, and I hope to learn what I can from all of you. Thanks!
